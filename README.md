## Features

- Supports both online and hot-seat play.
- 2-4 players

## Gameplay

1. Players are randomly assigned a province at the start of the game.
2. Each player receives 3 units at the start of each turn, plus one unit for every 3 provinces they hold.
3. On your turn you may attack neighboring provinces if you have the units. When attacking, you have a 50% chance of winning the battle. The loser of the battle loses one unit.
4. At the end of your turn, you may move units from one of your provinces to one of its neighbors you own.
5. A player is defeated when they no longer control any provinces.
6. A player wins when all other players are defeated.

## Features Planned

- Make battle more strategic than just 50-50.
- Provide feedback in the UI (perhaps in a log) of the results of actions like battle.
- Add computer-controller players
- Allow hot-seat games with fewer than 4 players

## Further-Out Ideas

- Unit bonuses for holding all tiles in a region.
- Instead of units, players gain currency which can be used to purchase units, or potentially territory upgrades like:
 - Stables grant an additional move per turn.
 - Mines grant extra currency per turn.
 - Castles grant defensive bonuses.
 - Harbors let you move from one coastal province with a harbor to any other.
