Unite feudal Japan in this Risk-like strategy game! (This is extremely alpha and in active development.)

## Gameplay

Up to 4 players: play against friends online, the computer, or both.

- Provinces are randomly divided amongst all players at the start of the game.
- Each player receives one unit for every 3 provinces they hold (with a minimum of 3) at the start of each turn.
- Receive bonus units for holding all provinces within a marked region.
- On your turn you may attack neighboring provinces. When attacking, you have a 50% chance of winning the battle. The loser of the battle loses one unit. If you defeat all units in a province, it becomes yours.
- At the end of your turn, you may move units from one of your provinces to one of its neighbors you control.
- A player is defeated when they no longer control any provinces.
- A player wins when all other players are defeated.

## Features Planned

- Make battle more strategic than just 50-50.
- Provide feedback in the UI (perhaps in a log) of the results of actions like battle.
- Allow hot-seat games with fewer than 4 players
- Let players choose their names

## Further-Out Ideas

- Instead of units, players gain currency which can be used to purchase units, or potentially territory upgrades like:
 - Stables grant an additional move per turn.
 - Mines grant extra currency per turn.
 - Castles grant defensive bonuses.
 - Harbors let you move from one coastal province with a harbor to any other.
